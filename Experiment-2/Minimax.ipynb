        "### Explanation of the Minimax Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided code implements the basic Minimax algorithm, which is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory, artificial intelligence, and statistics for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case (maximum loss) scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "1.  **`minimax(state, depth, maximizing_player)` function:**\n",
        "    *   `state`: Represents the current configuration of the game (e.g., a board state in chess). In this example, it's a simplified string or integer.\n",
        "    *   `depth`: The current depth of the search in the game tree. The algorithm explores a certain number of moves into the future.\n",
        "    *   `maximizing_player`: A boolean indicating whose turn it is. `True` for the player trying to maximize their score, `False` for the player trying to minimize the opponent's score.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Base Cases:**\n",
        "    *   If `is_terminal(state)` returns `True` (meaning the game has ended, e.g., a win, loss, or draw), the function returns the `evaluate_state(state)` directly. This is the final score for that terminal state.\n",
        "    *   If `depth == 0`, it means the search has reached its predefined limit. The function then returns the `evaluate_state(state)` as a heuristic approximation of the state's value.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Recursive Steps:**\n",
        "    *   **Maximizing Player:** If `maximizing_player` is `True`, the algorithm iterates through all `get_possible_moves(state)`. For each move, it simulates `make_move(state, move)` to get the `new_state` and recursively calls `minimax` for the *minimizing player* (`False`). It then selects the `max_eval` among all returned values, as the maximizing player wants the best possible outcome.\n",
        "    *   **Minimizing Player:** If `maximizing_player` is `False`, it does the opposite. It iterates through all possible moves, calls `minimax` for the *maximizing player* (`True`), and selects the `min_eval` value, as the minimizing player wants to limit the maximizing player's score.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Game Helper Functions:**\n",
        "*   `is_terminal(state)`: In a real game, this would check if the game has ended (e.g., if a player has won, lost, or drawn).\n",
        "*   `evaluate_state(state)`: In a real game, this function would assign a numerical value to a given game state. For terminal states, it's the actual outcome (+100 for win, -100 for loss, 0 for draw). For non-terminal states, it would be a heuristic evaluation (e.g., counting pieces, board control, etc.).\n",
        "*   `get_possible_moves(state)`: This function should return a list of all legal moves that can be made from the current `state`.\n",
        "*   `make_move(current_state, move)`: This function applies a `move` to the `current_state` and returns the `new_state` of the game after the move has been made.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use this algorithm for a specific game, you would need to implement `is_terminal`, `evaluate_state`, `get_possible_moves`, and `make_move` according to your game's rules."
